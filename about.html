    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a passionate, self-directed individual with a strong desire to
      continue learning and growing professionally. My organization and strong
      work ethic helps me achieve personal and team goals while maintaining a
      very approachable attitude. I also have a strong creative side that allows
      me to think innovatively and contribute to open discussions and ideas. My
      passion about Front-End Development began from a very young age. Ever
      since internet went live, I was very curious to check all the information
      online and I was so fascinated, always wondering how everything worked.
      The years passed and the "curious-cat" always remained in my brain. But my
      life had other plans, I graduated in Oriental Cultures and Languages and
      lived 4 years in Shanghai. When I finally had a little free-time, I was
      able to enroll in the Front-End world. I feel like I discovered a new
      world and I want to keep exploring it.
